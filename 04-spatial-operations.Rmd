# Spatial data operations

## Prerequisites {-}

- This chapter requires the packages **tidyverse**, **sf** and **raster**. 
To avoid confusing function names (e.g., `dplyr::select` and `raster::select`) we will wait with attaching the **raster** package until we reach section \@ref{spatial-operations-on-raster-data):

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
# library(raster)
```

- Please attach also the **spData** package which in turn automatically attaches the `world` dataset:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(spData)
```

## Introduction

Spatial operations are an important component of any geospatial software and vital for many applications involving spatial data.
There are clear overlaps between spatial and non-spatial operations.
Common spatial attribute data processing tasks include spatial subsetting (as we will see in section \@ref(spatial-subsetting) and section \@ref(raster-subsetting)), joining and aggregation (sections \@ref(spatial-joining-and-aggregation), \@ref(map-algebra) & \ref(merging-rasters)).
In the case of vector data, each of these spatial operations has a non-spatial equivalent, as demonstrated in section \@ref(vector-attribute-manipulation) in the previous chapter.
By contrast, subsetting is the only spatial raster operation we present in this chapter (section \@ref(spatial-operations-on-raster-data)) which also has a non-spatial counterpart.
Nevertheless, spatial raster and vector operations share many similarities, at least in terms of functionality though the internal processing is completely different.
Be careful with the wording.
Sometimes the same words have slightly different meanings for both data models.
<!-- maybe we should choose dissolving as the term here, aggregate is more R lingo-->
Aggregating in the case of vector data refers to dissolving polygons while it means increasing the resolution in the case of vector data.
Dissolving polygons also makes for a "coarser"" resolution, however, a better raster equivalent would be zonal operations where the cells of one raster are aggregated in accordance with the zones (categories) of another raster.

Some operations covered in this chapter are unique to spatial data.
A variety of *topological relations* can be used to subset/join vector geometries (by default **sf** uses the catch-all *intersects* but other relations such as *within* can be very useful), a topic that is explored in section \@ref(topological-relations).
New geometry data can be created by modifying existing spatial objects, using operations such as 'buffer' and 'clip', described in sections \@ref(modifying-geometry-data) and \@ref(map-algebra).
Another unique aspect of spatial objects is distance.
All features are related to each other in geographic space, and distance calculations resolve which spatial features are nearer or further away from a given point or each other (see sections \@ref(distance-relations) and \@ref(map-algebra)).
The final section in this chapter additionally explores how to align two raster objects in case their headers mismatch (section \@ref(aligning-rasters)).
This is especially important if we want to merge several rasters into one bigger raster or if we want to use several mismatching raster layers for algebraic operations.

```{block type='rmdnote'}
It is important to note that spatial operations that use two spatial objects rely on both objects having the same coordinate reference system, a topic that was introduced in \@ref(crs-intro) and which will be covered in more depth in Chapter 6.
```

## Spatial subsetting

Spatial subsetting is the process of selecting only those features of a spatial object that in some way *intersect* with another spatial object.
<!-- can we already reference the intersection figure here? Generally asking, why can't we present the other topological operations here? Would fit nicely in this section... -->
Note that 'intersect' in this context has a precise meaning:
if `y` is used to subset features in a 'target' object of `x`, any features in `x` that touch, overlap or are within features in `y` will be selected.
Intersect is the default operation for spatial subsetting but others can be used using the `op =`
argument.^[Interested
readers can see this default value of `op` set in the first line of the function call by entering its long-form name into the console: 
`` sf:::`[.sf` `` 
The `?sf` help page documents this also.
]
There are nine well-defined operations that can be used for spatial subsetting, covered in section \@ref(topological-relations).
This may seem daunting but the good news is that you do not have to learn all of them separately:
after you understand how to spatially subset objects that *intersect* another (via `st_intersects()`) it is easy to subset based on other types of spatial operation such as `st_touches()`, `st_crosses()` and `st_within()`.
For this reason now we focus only on one of the spatial subsetting operations.
We use `st_intersects()` instead of any of the others not only because it the default when subsetting with `[`,
but also `st_intersects()` is useful as a 'catch all' that identifies all types of spatial relations.

In general terms, spatial subsetting is simply the spatial equivalent of *attribute subsetting*.
As with attribute subsetting, spatial subsetting is a *binary operation*: an object is either selected or not.
Following the structure of section \@ref(vector-attribute-subsetting), we start with base methods before describing how to do it in the **tidyverse**.
<!-- todo: link to non-binary links, e.g. area-weighted spatial interpolation -->

<!-- ### Spatial subsetting in base R -->

To introduce spatial vector subsetting operations we will use countries in Africa.
We will apply attribute subsetting to the `world` dataset (see previous chapter):^[Recall
that we can also subset simple features using the `filter()` function, e.g. with `filter(world, continent == "Africa")`]

```{r}
africa_wgs = world[world$continent == "Africa", ]
```

To further prepare the input data, we will reproject the data to the coordinate reference system (CRS) 32630, its EPSG code (explained in Chapter 6):

```{r}
africa = st_transform(africa_wgs, crs = 32630)
```

We can also use the `[` operator for *Spatial* subsetting.
The difference is that we use *another spatial object* inside the square brackets instead of an `integer` or `logical` vector.
This is a concise and consistent syntax, as shown in the next code chunk.
Let's test it with a hypothetical scenario: we want to subset all countries within 20 degrees of the point where the equator (where latitude = 0 degrees) intersects the prime meridian (longitude = 0 degrees), as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:globe).
The subsetting object is created below.
Note that this must have the same CRS as the target object (set with the `crs` argument):

```{r, warning=FALSE}
center = st_sf(geometry = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 0)), crs = 4326))
buff = st_buffer(x = center, dist = 20)
buff = st_transform(buff, 32630)
```

```{r globe, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Hypothetical subsetting scenario: select all countries which intersect with a circle of 20 degrees in radius around planet Earth. Figure created with the **[globe](https://cran.r-project.org/package=globe)** package."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/globe.png")
```

The data to be subset, or 'target layer', is the `africa` object created above, which has a projected CRS (`32630`).
Subsequently,the spatial subsetting operation is a single, concise command:

```{r}
africa_buff = africa[buff, ]
```

Note that the command emits a message: about assuming `planar coordinates`.
This is because spatial operations (especially distance and area calculations) cannot be assumed to be accurate in a geographic (longitude/latitude) CRS.
In this case there is a clear justification: the data is close to the equator where there is least distortion caused by the curvature of the earth, and the example illustrates the method, which would more usually be used on projected ('planar') data.
In any case, the spatial subsetting clearly worked since only countries which spatially intersect with the giant circle are returned (Figure \@ref(fig:africa-buff)):

```{r africa-buff, fig.cap="Subset of the `africa` data selected based on their intersection with a circle 20 degrees in radius with a center point at 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude."}
plot(africa_buff["pop"])
plot(buff, add = TRUE)
```

Note that countries that just touch the giant circle are selected such as Algeria (the large country at the north of plot).
`st_relates()` includes countries that only touch (but are not within or overlapping with) the selection object.
Other spatial subsetting operations such as `st_within()` are more conservative, as shown in section \@ref(topological-relations).

Before we progress to explore the differences between different spatial subsetting operations, it is worth seeing alternative ways to achieve the same result,
to deepen understanding of what is going on 'under the hood' (which in turn is vital for developing advanced geocomputation applications).
The second way to reproduce the subsetting operation illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:africa-buff) simply involves expanding the operation over 2 lines:

```{r}
sel_buff = st_intersects(x = africa, y = buff, sparse = FALSE)
africa_buff2 = africa[sel_buff, ]
```

The third way is essentially the same as the second, but uses the `filter()` function introduced in section \@ref(vector-attribute-subsetting), forming the foundations of a 'tidy' spatial data analysis workflow.
If you already use **dplyr** for data manipulation, this way should seem familiar:

```{r}
africa_buff3 = africa %>%
  filter(st_intersects(x = ., y = buff, sparse = FALSE))
```

How can we be sure that the results are the same for the three subsetting operations?
We can test them as follows:

```{r}
identical(x = africa_buff, y = africa_buff2)
identical(x = africa_buff, y = africa_buff3)
```

The reason that the third spatially subset object (`africa_buff3`) is not identical is that **dplyr** changes the row names:

```{r}
head(row.names(africa_buff))
head(row.names(africa_buff3))
```

If the row names are re-set, the objects become identical:

```{r}
attr(africa_buff3, "row.names") = attr(x = africa_buff, "row.names")
identical(africa_buff, africa_buff3)
```

```{block type='rmdnote'}
This discarding of row names is not something that is specific to spatial
data, as illustrated in the code chunk below.
**dplyr** discards row names by design.
For further discussion of this decision, and some controversy, see the (closed) issue [#366](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/366) in the package's issue tracker.
```

```{r}
row.names(africa[africa$subregion == "Northern Africa", ])
row.names(filter(africa, subregion == "Northern Africa"))
```

## Spatial joining and aggregation 

Joining two non-spatial datasets relies on a shared 'key' variable, as described in section \@ref(vector-attribute-joining).
Spatial data joining applies the same concept, but instead relies on shared areas of geographic space.
As with attribute data joining adds a new column to the target object (the argument `x` in joining functions) from a source object (`y`).

The process is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-join), which shows a target object (the `world` dataset, left) being joined to a source dataset (the top 10 largest cities of the world), resulting in a new attribute being added to the `world` dataset (right).
<!-- Idea: use random points over Earth's surface to allocate data to world countries. -->

```{r}
urb = urban_agglomerations %>% 
  filter(year == 2020) %>% 
  top_n(n = 3, wt = population_millions)
asia = world %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia")
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
joined = st_join(x = asia, y = urb)
```


```{r spatial-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of a spatial join: the populations of the world's 3 largest agglomerations joined onto their respective countries.", fig.asp=0.4}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(urb$geometry, col = "white", main = "Target object")
plot(asia$geom, add = TRUE)
plot(urb["population_millions"], pch = 15, main = "Source object (points)")
plot(joined$geom, border = "grey", add = TRUE)
plot(urb["population_millions"], pch = 15, main = "Result of spatial join")
plot(joined["population_millions"], add = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

<!-- I would expand it a little bit on spatial joins. Typically, this operation is also known as spatial overlay. Of course, you can also use other geometries (lines), and especially you can not only use st_intersects (another reason why the topological stuff should have been already covered before). Also interesting would be to show what happens if there are multiple matches, e.g., multiple points per polygon. In sp, this was solved using a list containing the IDs of the matched objects while not returning the corresponding attribute table. Overall, a comparison with sp::over would be also interesting -->

Like attribute data aggregation, covered in section \@ref(vector-attribute-aggregation), spatial data aggregation (also known as dissolving polygons) can be a way of *condensing* data.
Aggregated data show some statistic about a variable (typically mean average or total) in relation to some kind of *grouping variable*. 
For attribute data aggregation the grouping variable is another variable, typically one with few unique values relative to the number of rows.
The `continent` variable in the `world` dataset is a good example:
there are only eight unique continents but 177 countries.
In section \@ref(vector-attribute-aggregation) the aggregation process condensed the `world` dataset down into only eight rows and an aggregated `pop` variable representing the total population per continent (see Figure \@ref(fig:continent-pop)).
<!-- CAREFUL, in fact, fig:continent-pop has already been a spatial operation (dissolving polygons). You should have shown the table only in the previous section --> 
Spatial data aggregation is the same conceptually but uses a *spatial* grouping object:
the *output* is the same, in terms of number of rows/features and geometry, as the *grouping object*, but with new variables corresponding to the input dataset.
As with spatial subsetting, spatial aggregation operations work by extending existing functions.
Since mid-2017 (with the release of **sf** `0.5-3`) the base R function `aggregate()` works with a spatial object as a grouping variable.

Building on the example presented the previous section (\@ref(spatial-subsetting)), we demonstrate this by aggregating the population of countries that intersect with the buffer represented by the circular `buff` object created in the previous section.

```{r}
buff_agg = aggregate(x = africa[, "pop"], by = buff, FUN = sum)
```
<!--
show also tidyverse way, so what you are doing is basically a spatial join and a subsequent aggregation without a grouping variable. Didactically, it might be better to present a grouping variable.
```{r}
st_join(buff, africa[, "pop"]) %>%
  summarize(pop = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE))
# summarize(africa[buff, "pop"], pop = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE))
```
-->

The result, `buff_agg`, is a spatial object with the same geometry as `by` (the circular buffer in this case) but with an additional variable, `pop` reporting summary statistics for all features in `x` that intersect with `by` (the total population of the countries that touch the buffer in this case).
Plotting the result (with `plot(buff_agg)`) shows that the operation does not really make sense:
Figure \@ref(fig:buff-agg) shows a population of over half a billion people mostly located in a giant circle floating off the west coast of Africa!  

```{r buff-agg, fig.cap="Result of spatial aggregation showing the total population of countries that intersect with a large circle whose center lies at 0 degrees longitude and latitude", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
pal = tmaptools::get_brewer_pal(palette = "BuPu", n = 4, plot = F)
breaks = c(0, 1e7, 1e8, 5e8, 1e9)
bb_buff = tmaptools::bb(buff_agg, ext = 1.5)
qtm(buff_agg, fill = pal[4], bbox = bb_buff) +
  tm_shape(africa_buff) +
  tm_fill("pop", palette = pal, breaks = breaks) +
  tm_borders() +
  qtm(africa[st_disjoint(africa, buff, sparse = FALSE), ]) +
  tm_shape(buff) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 3, lty = 3) +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "bottom"))
detach("package:tmap", unload = TRUE)
```

The results of the spatial aggregation exercise presented in Figure \@ref(fig:buff-agg) are unrealistic for three reasons:

- People do not live in the sea (the geometry of the aggregating object is not appropriate for the geometry target object).
- This method would 'double count' countries whose borders cross aggregating polygons when multiple, spatially contiguous, features are used as the aggregating object.
- It is wrong to assume that all the people living in countries that *touch* the buffer reside *within* it (the default spatial operator `st_intersects()` is too 'greedy'). The most extreme example of this is Algeria, the most northerly country selected:
the spatial aggregation operation assumes that all 39 million Algerian citizens reside in the tiny southerly tip that is within the circular buffer.

A number of methods can be used to overcome these issues, and generate a more realistic population attributed to the circular buffer illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:buff-agg).
The simplest of these is to convert the country polygons into points representing their *geographic centroids* before aggregation, covered in section \@ref(modifying-geometry-data).
<!-- Todo: reference section where we demonstrate geographic centroid generation -->
This would ensure that any spatially contiguous aggregating object covering the target object (the Earth in this case) would result in the same total: there would be no double counting.
The estimated total population residing within the study area would be more realistic if geographic centroids were used.
(The centroid of Algeria, for example, is far outside the aggregating buffer.)

Except in cases where the number of target features per aggregating feature is very large, or where the aggregating object is *spatially congruent* with the target (covered in section \@ref(spatial-congruence-and-areal-interpolation)), using centroids can also lead to errors due to boundary effects:
imagine a buffer that covers a large area but contains no centroids.
These issues can be tackled when aggregating areal target data with areal interpolation.

### Spatial congruence and areal interpolation

Spatial congruence is an important concept related to spatial aggregation.
An *aggregating object* object (which we will refer to as `y`, representing the buffer object in the previous section) is *congruent* with the target object (`x`, representing the countries in the previous section) if the two objects have shared borders.
Often this is the case for administrative boundary data, whereby the larger units (e.g. Middle Layer Super Output Areas in the UK) are composed of many smaller units (Output Areas in this case, see [ons.gov.uk](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography) for further details).

*Incongruent* aggregating objects, by contrast, do not share common borders with the target [@qiu_development_2012].
This is problematic for spatial aggregation (and other spatial operations) illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:areal-example).
Areal interpolation resolves this issue.
A number of algorithms have been developed for areal interpolation, including area weighted and pycnophylactic interpolation methods task [@tobler_smooth_1979].

```{r areal-example, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of congruent (left) and incongruent (right) areal units.", warning=FALSE, fig.asp=0.4}
rx = st_as_sf(raster::rasterToPolygons(raster::raster(ncol = 4, nrow = 4)))
ry = st_as_sf(raster::rasterToPolygons(raster::raster(ncol = 2, nrow = 2)))
rxo = st_as_sf(st_set_geometry(rx, NULL), geometry = rx$geometry + 15)
st_crs(rx) = NA
rx = rbind(rx, rxo)
set.seed(1985)
rx$value = rep(runif(nrow(rx) / 2), 2)
rx$layer = rep(c("Congruent", "Incongruent"), each = nrow(rxo))
library(tmap)
qtm(rx, "value") + tm_facets(by = "layer", drop.units = T, ncol = 2) +
    tm_shape(ry) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 10) +
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE)
detach("package:tmap", unload = TRUE)
```

The simplest useful method for spatial interpolation is *area weighted* spatial interpolation.
This is implemented in `st_interpolate_aw()`, as demonstrated below:

```{r}
buff_agg_aw = st_interpolate_aw(x = africa["pop"], to = buff, extensive = TRUE)
```

## Modifying geometry data

Spatial clipping is a form of spatial subsetting that involves changes to the `geometry` columns of at least some of the affected features.

Clipping can only apply to features more complex than points: 
lines, polygons and their 'multi' equivalents.
To illustrate the concept we will start with a simple example:
two overlapping circles with a centerpoint 1 unit away from each other and radius of 1:

```{r points, fig.cap="Overlapping circles."}
b = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 1)), st_point(c(1, 1))) # create 2 points
b = st_buffer(b, dist = 1) # convert points to circles
l = c("x", "y")
plot(b)
text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l) # add text
```

Imagine you want to select not one circle or the other, but the space covered by both `x` *and* `y`.
This can be done using the function `st_intersection()`, illustrated using objects named `x` and `y` which represent the left and right-hand circles:

```{r}
x = b[1]
y = b[2]
x_and_y = st_intersection(x, y)
plot(b)
plot(x_and_y, col = "lightgrey", add = TRUE) # color intersecting area
```

The subsequent code chunk demonstrate how this works for all combinations of the 'Venn' diagram representing `x` and `y`, inspired by [Figure 5.1](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#logical-operators) of the book R for Data Science [@grolemund_r_2016].
<!-- Todo: reference r4ds -->

```{r venn-clip, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Spatial equivalents of logical operators"}
par(mfrow = c(3, 3), mai = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))
plot(b)
y_not_x = st_difference(y, x)
plot(y_not_x, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_difference(y, x)")
plot(b)
plot(x, add = TRUE, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "x")
plot(b, add = TRUE)
x_or_y = st_union(x, y)
plot(x_or_y, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_union(x, y)")
x_and_y = st_intersection(x, y)
plot(b)
plot(x_and_y, col = "grey", add = TRUE) 
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_intersection(x, y)")
# x_xor_y = st_difference(x_xor_y, x_and_y) # failing
x_not_y = st_difference(x, y)
x_xor_y = st_sym_difference(x, y)
plot(x_xor_y, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_sym_difference(x, y)")
plot.new()
plot(b)
plot(x_not_y, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_difference(x, y)")
plot(b)
plot(y, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
plot(b, add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "y")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

To illustrate the relationship between subsetting and clipping spatial data, we will subset points that cover the bounding box of the circles `x` and `y` in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-clip).
Some points will be inside just one circle, some will be inside both and some will be inside neither.
To generate the points will use a function not yet covered in this book, `st_sample()`.

There are two different ways to subset points that fit into combinations of the circles: via clipping and logical operators.
But first we must generate some points.
We will use the *simple random* sampling strategy to sample from a box representing the extent of `x` and `y`, using the code below to generate the situation plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-subset):

```{r venn-subset, fig.cap="Randomly distributed points within the bounding box enclosing circles x and y."}
bb = st_bbox(st_union(x, y))
pmat = matrix(c(bb[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2)]), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
box = st_polygon(list(pmat))
set.seed(2017)
p = st_sample(x = box, size = 10)
plot(box)
plot(x, add = T)
plot(y, add = T)
plot(p, add = T)
text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# An alternative way to sample from the bb
bb = st_bbox(st_union(x, y))
pmulti = st_multipoint(pmat)
box = st_convex_hull(pmulti)
```

## Distance relations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_distance(a, b)
```

## Spatial operations on raster data
This section builds on \@ref(manipulating-raster-objects), which highlights various basic methods for manipulating raster datasets, to demonstrate more advanced and explicitly spatial raster operations,
and uses the same object `elev` and `grain`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("code/create-rasters.R")
```

### Spatial subsetting {#raster-subsetting}
In the previous chapter (section \@ref(manipulating-raster-objects)) we have already learned how to subset raster datasets using cell IDs and matrix indexing.
Naturally, we can subset rasters also with the help of coordinates and spatial objects.
To use coordinates for subsetting, we have to 'translate' them into the corresponding cell ID(s) or by using the `extract()` command.
This operation is also known as extracting values/attributes to points.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# point within the top left pixel
elev[cellFromXY(elev, xy = c(-1.5, 1.5))]
# the same as
extract(elev, data.frame(x = -1.5, y = 1.5))
```

The `cellFromXY()` and the `extract()` command accept also a `SpatialPoints` or `SpatialPointsDataFrame` object (though not an **sf** object).
We can also use a raster object to subset another raster object (Figure \@ref(fig:raster-subset) left panel).

```{r}
clip = raster(nrow = 3, ncol = 3, res = 0.3, xmn = 0.9, xmx = 1.8, 
              ymn = -0.45, ymx = 0.45, vals = rep(1, 9))
elev[clip]
# we can also use extract
# extract(elev, extent(clip))
```

Basically, this amounts to retrieving the values of the first raster (here: `elev`) falling within the extent of a second raster (here: `clip`).
To retrieve a spatial output, we can tell R to keep the matrix structure.
This will return the two output values as a raster object.

```{r}
elev[clip, drop = FALSE]
```

For the same operation we can also use the `intersect()` and `crop()` command.

```{r raster-subset, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Subsetting raster values with the help of another raster (left). Raster mask (middle). Output of masking a raster."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/04_raster_subset2.png")
```

Frequently, however, we have two rasters with the same extent and resolution where one raster object serves as a mask (Figure \@ref(fig:raster-subset) middle and right panel).
In these cases `intersect()` and `crop()` are of little use.
Instead we can use the `[` again or the `mask()` and `overlay()` commands:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmask = raster(nrow = 6, ncol = 6, res = 0.5, 
               xmn = -1.5, xmx = 1.5, ymn = -1.5, ymx = 1.5,
               vals = sample(c(FALSE, TRUE), 36, replace = TRUE))
elev[rmask, drop = FALSE]
# using the mask command
mask(elev, rmask, maskvalue = TRUE)
# using overlay
# first we replace FALSE by NA
rmask[rmask == FALSE] = NA
# then we retrieve the maximum values
overlay(elev, rmask, fun = "max")
```

In the code chunk above, we have created a mask object called `rmask` randomly setting its values to `FALSE` and `TRUE`.
Next we only want to keep those values of `elev` which are `TRUE` in `rmask`, or expressed differently, we want to mask `elev` with `rmask`.
These operations are in fact Boolean local operations since we compare cell-wise two rasters.
The next subsection explores these and related operations in more detail.

###  Map algebra
Map algebra makes raster processing really fast.
This is because raster datasets only implicitly store coordinates.
To derive the coordinate of a specific cell, we have to calculate it using its matrix position and the raster resolution and origin.
For the processing, however, the geographic position of a cell is barely relevant as long as we make sure that the cell position is still the same after the processing (one-to-one locational correspondence).
Additionally, if two or more raster datasets share the same extent, projection and the resolution, one could treat them as matrices for the processing.
This is exactly what map algebra is doing.
First, it checks the headers of the rasters on which to perform any algebraic operation, and only if they correspondent to each other, the processing goes on.
And secondly, map algebra retains the so-called one-to-one locational correspondence.
This is where it substantially differs from matrix algebra which changes positions when for example multiplying or dividing matrices.

Map algebra (or cartographic modeling) divides raster operations into four subclasses [@tomlin_geographic_1990], with each of them either working on one or several grids simultaneously:

1. *Local* or per-cell operations.
2. *Focal* or neighborhood operations.
Most often the output cell value is the result of a 3 x 3 input cell block.
3. *Zonal* operations are similar to focal operations but instead of a predefined neighborhood, classes, which can take on any, i.e., also an irregular size and shape, are the basis for calculations.
4. *Global* or per-raster operations, that means the output cell derives its value potentially from one or several entire rasters

This classification scheme uses basically the number of cells involved in a processing step as distinguishing feature.
Of course, one can classify raster operations based on other characteristics such as discipline.
Think, for instance, of terrain, hydrological analysis or image classifications.
In the following paragraphs, we will explain each of the four map algebra operations by example.

**Local** operations comprise all cell-by-cell operations in one or several layers.
A good example is the classification of intervals of numeric values into groups such as grouping a digital elevation model into low (class 1), middle (class 2) and high elevations (class 3).
Using the `reclassify()` command, we need first to construct a reclassification matrix, where the first column corresponds to the lower and the second column to the upper end of the class.
The third column represents the new value for the specified ranges in column one and two.
Here, we assign the raster values in the ranges 0--12, 12--24 and 24--36 are *reclassified* to take values 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rcl = matrix(c(0, 12, 1, 12, 24, 2, 24, 36, 3), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
recl = reclassify(elev, rcl = rcl)
```

Raster algebra is another classical use case of local operations.
This includes adding, subtracting and squaring two rasters.
Raster algebra also allows logical operations such as finding all raster cells that are greater than a specific value (5 in our example below).
The **raster** package allows all these operations in a way natural to R users.
Please see the `Raster`-vignette for a more detailed description on algebraic operations (`vignette("Raster", package = "raster")`).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
elev + elev
elev^2
log(elev)
elev > 5
```

Instead of arithmetic operators, you can also use the `calc()` and `overlay()` functions.
These functions are more efficient.
So you should use them if you have to process large raster datasets. 
Additionally, they let you directly store an output file.

The calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of the most famous local, i.e. pixel-by-pixel, raster operations.
It ranges between - 1 and 1 with positive values indicating the presence of living plants (mostly > 0.2).
To calculate the NDVI, one uses the red and near-infrared bands of remotely sensed imagery (e.g., Landsat or Sentinel imagery) exploiting the fact that vegetation absorbs light heavily in the visible light spectrum, and especially in the red channel, while reflecting it in the near-infrared spectrum.

$$
\begin{split}
NDVI&= \frac{\text{NIR} - \text{Red}}{\text{NIR} + \text{Red}}\\
\end{split}
$$
where NIR = near infrared channel
      Red = red channel

Predictive mapping is another interesting application of local raster operations.
The response variable correspond to measured or observed points in space, for example, species richness, the presence of landslides, tree disease or crop yield.
Consequently, we can easily retrieve space- or airborne predictor variables from various rasters (elevation, pH, precipitation, temperature, landcover, soil class, etc.).
Subsequently, we model our response as a function of our predictors using `lm`, `glm`, `gam` or a machine-learning technique. 
To make a spatial prediction, all we have to do, is to apply the estimated coefficients to the predictor rasters, and summing up the resulting output rasters (<!--Chapter ??; -->see also @muenchow_predictive_2013).
<!-- add reference to chapter ecological modeling -->

While local functions operate on one cell, though possibly from multiple layers, **focal** operations take into account a central cell and its neighbors.
The neighborhood (also named kernel, filter or moving window) under consideration is typically of size 3-by-3 cells (that is the central cell and its eight surrounding neighbors) but can take on any other (not necessarily rectangular) shape as defined by the user.
A focal operation applies an aggregation function to all cells within the specified neighborhood, uses the corresponding output as the new value for the the central cell, and moves on to the next central cell (Figure \@ref(fig:focal-example)).
Other names for this operation are spatial filtering and convolution [@burrough_principles_2015].

In R, we can use the `focal()` function to perform spatial filtering. 
We define the shape of the moving window with a `matrix` whose values correspond to weights.
Secondly, the the `fun` argument lets us specify the function we wish to apply to this neighborhood.
Here, we choose the minimum, but of course we can use any other function such as the the sum, the mean, the median, the mode, the maximum or the variance.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
r_focal = focal(elev, w = matrix(1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3), fun = min)
```

```{r focal-example, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Input raster (left) and resulting output raster (right) due to a focal operation - summing up 3-by-3 windows"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/04_focal_example.png")
```

We can quickly check if the output meets our expectations.
In our example, the minimum value has to be always the upper left corner of the moving window (remember we have created the input raster by rowwise incrementing the cell values by one starting at the upper left corner).
Of course, the `focal()`-function has computed the correct result.
In this example, our weighting matrix consists only of 1s.
This means each cell has the same weight on the output.
If appropriate, you can change this by specifying different weights.

Focal functions or filters play a dominant role in image processing.
Low-pass or smoothing filters use the mean function to remove extremes.
In the case of categorical data, we can replace the mean with the mode, which is the most common value.
By contrast, high-pass filters accentuate features.
The line detection Laplace and Sobel filters might serve as an example here.
Check the `focal()` help page how to use them in R.

Also, terrain processing uses heavily focal functions.
Think, for instance, of the calculation of the slope, aspect and flow directions.
The `terrain()` function lets you compute a few of these terrain characteristics but has not implemented all popular methods
For example, the Zevenbergen and Thorne method to compute the slope is missing.
Equally, many other terrain and GIS functions are **not** implemented in R such as curvatures, contributing areas, different wetness indexes, and many more.
Fortunately, desktop GIS commonly provide these algorithms.
In Chapter 13 we will learn how to access GIS functionality from within R.
<!-- Reference 13-gis chapter -->

*Zonal* operations are similar to focal operations.
The difference is that zonal filters can take on any shape instead of just a predefined window.
Our grain size raster is a good example (Figure \@ref(fig:cont-cate-rasters)) because the different grain sizes are spread in an irregular fashion throughout the raster.

To find the mean elevation for each grain size class, we can use the `zonal()` command.
This kind of operation is also known as *zonal statistics* in the GIS world. 

```{r}
z = zonal(elev, grain, fun = "mean") %>%
  as.data.frame
z
```

This returns the statistics for each category, here the mean altitude for each grain size class.
Of course, we can add this statistic to the attribute table of the ratified raster (see previous chapter).

*Global* operations are a special case of zonal operations with the entire raster dataset representing a single zone.
The most common global operations are descriptive statistics for the entire raster dataset such as the minimum or maximum (see previous chapter).
Aside from that, global operations are also useful for the computation of distance and weight rasters.
In the first case, one can calculate the distance from each cell to a specific target cell.
For example, one might want to compute the distance to the nearest coast (see also `raster::distance()`).
We might also want to consider topography, that means, we are not only interested in the pure distance but would like also to avoid the crossing of mountain ranges when going to the coast.
To do so, we can weight the distance with elevation so that each additional altitudinal meter 'prolongs' the euclidean distance.
Visibility and viewshed computations also belong to the family of global operations <!--(in the exercises of Chapter ?? you will compute a viewshed raster)-->.
<!-- reference 13-gis chapter-->

Many map algebra operations have a counterpart in vector processing [@liu_essential_2009; Table \@ref(tab:mapalg_vector))].
Computing a distance raster (zonal operation) while only considering a maximum distance (logical focal operation) is the equivalent to a vector buffer operation (section \@ref(modifying-geometry-data)).
Reclassifying raster data (either local or zonal function depending on the input) is equivalent to dissolving vector data (section \@ref(spatial-joining-and-aggregation)). 
Overlaying two rasters (local operation), where one contains `NULL` or `NA` values representing a mask, is similar to vector clipping (section \@ref(modifying-geometry-data)).
Quite similar to spatial clipping is intersecting two layers (section \@ref(spatial-subsetting)). 
The difference is that two these two layers (vector or raster) simply share an overlapping area (see Figure \@ref(fig:venn-clip) for an example).

### Merging rasters
Suppose we would like to compute the NDVI (see focal functions of the previous section), and additionally want to compute terrain attributes from elevation data for observations within a study area.
Before such computations we would have to acquire airborne or remotely sensed information.
The corresponding imagery is often divided into scenes covering a specific spatial extent.
Frequently, a study area covers more than one scene.
In these cases we would like to merge the scenes covered by our study area. 
In the easiest case, we can just merge these scenes, that is put them side to side.
This is possible with digital elevation data (SRTM, ASTER).
In the following code chunk we first download the SRTM elevation data for Austria and Switzerland (for the country codes have a look at `ccodes()`).
In a second step, we merge the two rasters into one.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
aut = getData("alt", country = "AUT", mask = TRUE)
ch = getData("alt", country = "CHE", mask = TRUE)
aut_ch = merge(aut, ch)
```

**Raster**'s `merge()` command combines two images, and in case they overlap, it uses the value of the first raster.
You can do exactly the same with `gdalUtils::mosaic_rasters()` which is faster, and therefore recommended if you have to merge a multitude of large rasters stored on disk.

The merging approach is of little use when the overlapping values do not correspond to each other.
This is frequently the case when you want to combine spectral imagery from scenes that were taken on different dates.
The `merge()` command will still work but you will see a clear border in the resulting image.
The `mosaic()` command lets you define a function for the overlapping area. 
For instance, we could compute the mean value. 
This might smooth the clear border in the merged result but it will most likely not make it disappear.
To do so, we need a more advanced approach. 
Remote scientist frequently apply histogram matching or use regression techniques to align the values of the first image with those of the second image.
The packages **landsat** (`histmatch()`, `relnorm()`, `PIF()`), **satellite** (`calcHistMatch()`) and **RStoolbox** (`histMatch()`, `pifMatch()`) provide the corresponding functions.

### Aligning rasters
When merging or performing map algebra on rasters, their resolution, projection, origin and/or extent has to match.
Otherwise, how should we add the values of one raster with a resolution of 0.2 decimal degrees to a second with a resolution of 1 decimal degree?
The same problem arises when we would like to merge satellite imagery from different sensors with different projections and resolutions.
We can deal with such mismatches by aligning the rasters.

The `projectRaster()` function reprojects one raster to a desired projection, say from UTM to WGS84.
The origin is the point closest to (0, 0) if you moved towards it in steps of x and y resolution.
If two rasters have different origins, their cells do not overlap completely which would make map algebra impossible.
To change the origin , use `origin()`.^[If the origins of two raster datasets are just marginally apart, it sometimes is sufficient to simply increase the `tolerance` argument  of `raster::rasterOptions()`.]
Equally, map algebra operations require the same extent.
To align the extent of one object with that of another, use the `extend()` command.
If you perform an algebraic operation on two objects with differing extents in R, the **raster** package returns the intersection, and says so in a warning (try: `elev + extend(elev, 2)`).

The `aggregate()` and `disaggregate()` functions help to change the cell size resolution of a raster.
For instance let us aggregate `elev` from a resolution of 0.5 to a resolution of 1, that means we aggregate by a factor of 2.
Additionally, the output cell value should correspond to the mean of the input cells (but  you can use any other function as well):

```{r}
elev_agg = aggregate(elev, fact = 2, fun = mean)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(elev)
plot(elev_agg)
```

Note that the origin of `elev_agg` has changed, too.
The `resample()` command lets you align several raster properties in one go, namely origin, extent and resolution.
Let us resample an extended `elev_agg` to the properties of `elev` again.

```{r}
# add 2 rows and columns, i.e. change the extent
elev_agg = extend(elev_agg, 2)
elev_disagg = resample(elev_agg, elev)
```

Though our disaggregated `elev_disagg` retrieved back its original resolution, cell size and extent, its values differ. 
However, this is to be expected, disaggregating **cannot** predict values at a finer resolution, it simply uses an interpolation algorithm.
It is important to keep in mind that disaggregating results in a finer resolution, the corresponding values, however, are only as accurate as their lower resolution source.

Finally, if you want to align many (possibly hundreds or thousands of) images stored on disk, you might want to checkout the `gdalUtils::align_rasters()` function.
Nevertheless, you may also use **raster** with very large datasets. 
This is because **raster**:

1. lets you work with raster datasets that are too large to fit into the main memory (RAM) by only processing chunks of it.
2. tries to fascilitate parallel processing.
For more information have a look at the help pages of `beginCluster()` and `clusteR()`.
Additionally, check out the *Multi-core functions* section in `vignette("functions", package = "raster")`.
