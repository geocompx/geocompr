## Introduction

This chapter demonstrates how the skills learned in the previous chapters can be applied to location analysis.
Location analysis is a broad field of research and (largely commercial) application, the aim of which is to decide the optimal location for interventions.
A typical example is where to locate a new shop: there are typically hundreds of possible locations in a city and location analysis can be used to decide where the shop will attract most visitors and, ultimately, make most profit.
There are also many non-commercial applications that can use the technique for public benefit.
A good example is where to locate new health services so for the benefit of the maximum number of people [@tomintz_geography_2008].

Ecological concepts can be useful in understanding location analysis.
Animals have needs which they tend to meet by finding the optimal location based on variables that change over space (called gradients in the ecological literature --- see chapter xx).
A polar bear, for example, may prefer northern latitudinal regions where the ice is persistent throughout the summer, where the food (seals and sea lions) and shelter it has evolved for are plentiful.
The further the bear lives from such conditions, the less likely is its survival.

Similarly, a service can have an economic niche.
There are locations of low and high turnovers, based on a range of variables that change over geographic space.
The main task of geomarketing to answer the question: where are optimal locations for services based on available data?
Typical geomarketing sub-questions include:

- Where are the service users (or clients), specific target groups and competitors?
- How many people can easily reach my stores?
- Do existing services over or under-exploit the market potential?
- How big is my market share and turnovers, and are there spatial differences?

## Use case

Imagine your are launching a cycling company and would like to open shops across urban areas of Germany.
Survey data reveals who the current clients are: males between 20-40 years old who live alone or with just one person (single households, not families).
In this hypothetical example the following procedure could be used to find suitable locations for the stores:

<!-- just internal structure and brain storming -->
- download German census data and convert it into a raster (resolution: 1 km^2^)
- find metropolitan areas, i.e. aggregate to a resolution of 10 sq-km (define a threshold for metropolitan areas, and point out that there are still more advanced ways to do so)
- download OSM, find bike shops + other interesting POIs.
Create a POI raster (= attraction raster)
- restrict to metropolitan areas
- weights:
  - reclassify age raster: 16-40 weight = 2; all other weight = 1
  - reclassify gender raster:
  - reclassify household raster
	- POIs: reclassify into 5 classes, the more POIs, the better
	- finally map algebra: age + gender + POI raster will show the most favorable locations
- Exercise: download the 100 m census inhabitant data and convert it into a raster (will be used in the chapter continuing location analysis)
  
In an advanced chapter we could continue the analysis as follows:
 - restrict our analysis to Nuremberg (but point out that we could do the whole analysis simultaneously for all metropolitan areas in Germany)
 - choose optimal location based on number of inhabitants -> you should reach as much people within 15 minutes as possible (routing, catchment area)
 - the farther away we get from a shop, the more unlikely people will go to our shop (-> decay distance)
 - however, we have to take into account that there are already competitors (huff model, attraction) 
 
## Create input rasters

The German government provides a csv-file containing gridded census data of 2011 for Germany.
You can either download a 1 km or a 100 m resolution.
Here, we download the 1 km data, unzip it and read it into R.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
url = paste0("https://www.zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/", 
             "Pressemitteilung/DemografischeGrunddaten/csv_Zensusatlas_", 
             "klassierte_Werte_1km_Gitter.zip?__blob=publicationFile&v=8")
download.file(url = url, destfile = file.path(tempdir(), "census.zip"),
              method = "auto", mode = "wb")
# list the file names
nms = unzip(file.path(tempdir(), "census.zip"), list = TRUE)
# unzip only the csv file
base_name = grep(".csv$", nms$Name, value = TRUE)
unzip(file.path(tempdir(), "census.zip"), files = base_name, exdir = tempdir())
# read in the csv file
input = readr::read_csv2(file.path(tempdir(), base_name))
```

Next we select the variables we need: x and y coordinates, the number of inhabitants (population), mean age, portion of women and the household size. 
Additionally, we set the values -1 and -9 to `NA` since these values are unknown.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# pop = population, hh_size = household size
input = dplyr::select(input, x = x_mp_1km, y = y_mp_1km, pop = Einwohner,
                      women = Frauen_A, mean_age = Alter_D,
                      hh_size = HHGroesse_D)
# set -1 and -9 to NA
input = mutate_all(input, funs(ifelse(. %in% c(-1, -9), NA, .)))
```

After the data preprocessing, we convert the table into a raster stack.
First, we use the x- and y-coordinates to convert the `data.frame` into a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` (we do not use sf-objects here, since the **raster** package does not support `sf`).
`gridded()` converts a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` into a `SpatialPixelsDataFrame` which in turn can be used as an input for **raster**'s `stack()` function.
The final raster stack consists of four layers: inhabitants, mean age, portion of women and household size (Fig. \@ref(fig:census-stack).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# convert table into a raster (x and y are cell midpoints)
coordinates(input) =~ x + y
# use the correct projection
proj4string(input) = CRS("+init=epsg:3035")
gridded(input) = TRUE
# convert into a raster stack
input = stack(input)
```

```{r census-stack, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Gridded German census data of 2011. Population (6 classes, number of persons): 1: 3-250, 2: 250-500, 3: 500-2000, 4: 4000-8000, 5: >8000; women (5 classes, %): 1: 0-40, 2: 40-47, 3: 47-53, 4: 53-60, 5: >60; mean age (5 classes, years): 1: 0-40, 2: 40-42, 3: 42-44, 4: 44-47, 5: >47; household size (5 classes, number of persons): 1: 1-2, 2: 2-2.5, 3: 2.5-3, 4: 3-3.5, 5: >3.5."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/08_census_stack.png")
```


## Define metropolitan areas

We arbitrarily define a a pixel of 20000 sq-km as metropolitan if more than half a million people lives in it.
To do so, we first `reclassify()` (see also section \@ref(local-operations)) the ordinal-scaled inhabitant data into a numeric data type using class means.
This means we use 127 for class 1 (ranging from 3 to 250 inhabitants), 375 for class 2 (ranging from 250 to 500 inhabitants), etc. ^[See also the Excel Sheet Datensatzbeschreibung lines 20 to 28 of the data description "Datensatzbeschreibung_klassierte_Werte_1km-Gitter.xlsx" located also in the downloaded file census.zip.
Unfortunately, the description is in German, but you get the meaning of the numbers.] 
We arbitrarily chose 8000 inhabitants for class 6 since it contains all raster cells greater than 8000.
Of course, this is only a simple approximation of the true population number (in the exercises you can explore the introduced error in more detail), however, for our purpose of delineating metropolitan areas the level of detail is good enough.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rcl = matrix(c(1, 1, 127, 2, 2, 375, 3, 3, 1250, 4, 4, 3000, 5, 5, 6000,
               6, 6, 8000), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
inh = reclassify(input$inh, rcl = rcl, right = NA)
```

The `aggregate()` command helps to change the resolution from 1 to 20000 sq-km while each output pixel represents the sum of all 1 sq-km input pixels (see section \@ref(aligning-rasters)).
Next, we only keep pixels with more than half a million inhabitants using a boolean operation, and convert the resulting pixels into spatial polygons of class `sf`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
inh_agg = aggregate(inh, fact = 20000 / res(inh)[1], fun = sum)
# plot(inh_agg > 500000)
polys = rasterToPolygons(inh_agg[inh_agg > 500000, drop = FALSE])
polys = st_as_sf(polys)
```

Plotting these polygons reveals eight metropolitan regions.
Each region consists of one ore more polygons (pixels).
It would be nice if we could join all polygons belonging to one region.
One approach is to dissolve all polygons (see section \@ref(aggregating-or-dissolving)).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
polys = summarize(polys, pop = sum(layer))
```

This returns one multipolygon feature with its elements corresponding to the metropolitan regions. 
To extract these polygons from the multipolygon, we can use `st_cast()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
metros = st_cast(polys, "POLYGON")
``` 

The warning message tells us that the attributes are repeated for all sub-geometries.
Here, this means that each region receives the total population of all metropolitan areas combined.
Clearly this is wrong but here we can safely ignore this since we are merely interested in the geometry.

<!-- maybe a good if advanced exercise
This requires finding the nearest neighbors (`st_intersects()`), and some additional processing.
Do not worry too much about the following code.
There is probably a better way to do it. 
Nevertheless, it finds all pixels belonging to one region in a generic way.
We use this information to assign each polygon (pixel) to a region.
Subsequently, we can use the region information to dissolve the pixels into region polygons.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# dissolve on spatial neighborhood
nbs = st_intersects(polys, polys)
# nbs = over(polys, polys, returnList = TRUE)

fun = function(x, y) {
  tmp = lapply(y, function(i) {
  if (any(x %in% i)) {
   union(x, i)
  } else {
   x
    }
  })
  Reduce(union, tmp)
}
# call function recursively
fun_2 = function(x, y) {
  out = fun(x, y)
  while (length(out) < length(fun(out, y))) {
    out = fun(out, y)
  }
  out
}

cluster = map(nbs, ~ fun_2(., nbs) %>% sort)
# just keep unique clusters
cluster = cluster[!duplicated(cluster)]
# assign the cluster classes to each pixel
for (i in seq_along(cluster)) {
  polys[cluster[[i]], "region_id"] = i
}
# dissolve pixels based on the the region id
polys = group_by(polys, region_id) %>%
  summarize(pop = sum(layer, na.rm = TRUE))
# polys_2 = aggregate(polys, list(polys$region_id), sum)
plot(polys[, "region_id"])

# Another approach, can be also be part of an excercise

coords = st_coordinates(polys_3) %>% 
  as.data.frame
ls = split(coords, f = coords$L2)
ls = lapply(ls, function(x) {
  dplyr::select(x, X, Y) %>%
    as.matrix %>%
    list %>%
    st_polygon
})
metros = do.call(st_sfc, ls)
metros = st_set_crs(metros, 3035)
metros = st_sf(data.frame(region_id = 1:9), geometry = metros)
st_intersects(metros, metros)
plot(metros[-5,])
st_centroid(metros) %>%
  st_coordinates
```
-->

However, visual inspection reveals eight metropolitan areas whereas the dissolving comes up with nine.
This is because one polygon just touches the corner of another polygon (western Germany, Cologne/Düsseldorf area).
One could assign it to the neighboring region using another dissolving procedure, however, we leave this as an exercise to the reader, and simply delete the offending polygon.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# find out about the offending polygon
int = st_intersects(metros, metros)
# polygons 5 and 9 share one border, delete polygon number 5
metros = metros[-5, ]
```

The defined metropolitan areas suitable for bike shops are still missing a name.
A reverse geocoding approach can help with that.
Given a coordinate, reverse gecoding finds the corresponding address.
Consequently, extracting the centroid coordinate of each metropolitan area can serve as an input for a reverse geocoding API.
The **ggmap** package makes use of the one provided by Google.^[Note that Google allows each user to access its services on a free basis for a maximum of 2500 queries a day.]
Since `ggmap::revgeocode()` only accepts lat/lon coordinates, the first requirement is to bring the metropolitan polygons into an appropriate projection.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# reverse geocoding to find out the names of the metropolitan areas
metros_wgs = st_transform(metros, 4326)
coords = st_centroid(metros_wgs) %>%
  st_coordinates %>%
  round(., 4)
```

`ggmap::revgeocode()` accepts one coordinate at a time.
Therefore, we iterate over each coordinate of `coords` via a loop (`ldply()`).
`ldply()` does exactly the same as `lapply()` except for returning a `data.frame` instead of a `list`.
We are also good citizens in trying not to overburden the server with too many queries within a short amount of time. 
Instead we let the algorithm sleep between one and four seconds before accessing the reverse geocoding API again.
Sometimes, the reverse geocoding API of Google is unable to find an address returning `NA`.
Often enough trying the same coordinate again, returns an address at the second or third attempt (see `while()-loop`).
However, if three attempts have already failed, this is a good indication that the requested information is indeed unavailable.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
metro_names = plyr::ldply(1:nrow(coords), function(i) {
  # give the server a bit time
  Sys.sleep(sample(seq(1, 4, 0.1), 1))
  add = ggmap::revgeocode(coords[i, ], output = "more")
  x = 2
  while (is.na(add$address) & x > 0) {
    add = ggmap::revgeocode(coords[i, ], output = "more")
    # just try three times
    x = x - 1
  }
  add
})
```

Choosing `more` as `revgeocode()`'s `output` option will give back a `data.frame` with several columns referring to the location including the address, locality and various administrative levels.
Overall, we are satisfied with the `locality` column serving as metropolitan names (Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig) bar one exception, namely Velbert.
Hence, we replace Velbert with the correponding name in the `administrative_area_level_2` column, that is Düsseldorf.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
metro_names = select(locality, administrative_area_level_2)
# replace Velbert
metro_names = 
  mutate(metro_names, 
         locality = ifelse(locality == "Velbert",
                           administrative_area_level_2, locality)) %>%
  select(locality) %>%
  pull
```

## Points of interests

OpenStreetMap is definition (VGI).
In the meantime the Vollständigkeit and quality is often comparable to that of commercial data providers (TomTom, Here).
The **osmdata** package provides a fantastic and easy-to-use interface to download OSM data.
Here, we will download all shops for each metropolitan region.
`opq()` defines the bounding box for the area for which data should be retrieved.
You can provide the bounding box yourself or indicate the name of a location.
We use the name of the metropolitan regions to define the bounding boxes. 
Furthermore, we indicate that we only would like download `shop` features (see for a full list).
`osmdata_sf()` returns a list with several spatial objects (points, lines, polygons, etc.).
Here, we will only keep the point objects.
To learn more about how to use the **osmdata**-package, please refer to [https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(osmdata)
shops = lapply(metro_names, function(x) {
  # give the server a bit time
  Sys.sleep(sample(seq(5, 10, 0.1), 1))
  q0 = opq(x)
  q1 = add_osm_feature(q0, key = "shop")
  points = osmdata_sf(q1)
  # request the same data again if nothing has been downloaded
  iter = 3
  while (nrow(points$osm_points) == 0 & iter > 0) {
    points = osmdata_sf(q1)
    iter = iter - 1
  }
  points = points$osm_points
  points = st_set_crs(points, 4326)
  })
```

Make sure that each list elements has at least a few features:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (any(sapply(shops, nrow) == 0)) {
  message("There is still a metropolitan area without any features. Please fix!")
}
```

If so, we select only the shop column, and finally bind all shops into one large sf-object.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# select only the shop column and rbind all list elements
shops = lapply(shops, select, shop)
shops = Reduce(rbind, shops)
```



```{r, eval = FALSE}
shops$count = 1
shops = st_transform(shops, proj4string(input$inh))
shops = as(shops, "Spatial")
# create poi raster
poi = input$inh
poi[] = NA
poi = rasterize(x = shops, y = poi, field = "count", fun = "sum")
plot(poi, xlim = c(4380000, 4420000), ylim = c(2920000, 2940000))
```

## Exercises

1. Donwload the csv file containing inhabitant information for a 100 m cell resolution ( https://www.zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Pressemitteilung/DemografischeGrunddaten/csv_Bevoelkerung_100m_Gitter.zip?__blob=publicationFile&v=3).
Please note that the unzipped file has a size of 1.23 GB.
To read it into R you can use `readr::read_csv`.
This takes 30 seconds on my machine (16 GB RAM)
`data.table::fread()` might be even faster, and returns an object of class `data.table()`.
Use `as.tibble()` to convert it into a tibble.
Build an inhabitant raster, aggregate it to a cell resolution of 1 km, and compare the difference with the inhabitant raster (`inh`) we have created using class mean values.
1. In the text we have deleted one polygon of the `metros` object (polygon number 5) since it only touches the border of another polygon.
Recreate the `metros` object and instead of deleting polygon number 5, make it part of the Cologne/Düsseldorf metropolitan region (hint: create a column named region_id, add polygon number 5 to the Cologne/Düsseldorf area and dissolve).
1. Suppose our bike shop predominantly sold E-bikes to older people. 
Change the age raster accordingly, repeat the remaining analyses and compare the changes with our original result.
