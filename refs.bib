  abstract = {Climate change is a global problem and across the world there are major difficulties being experienced in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The transport sector in particular is finding it difficult to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper reports on two studies carried out by the authors in London (UK) and Delhi (India). It considers the common objectives for transport CO2 reduction, but the very different contexts and baselines, potentials for change, and some possible synergies.

Different packages of measures are selected and scenarios developed for each context which are consistent with contraction and convergence objectives. CO2 reduction potentials are modelled and quantified by package and scenario. London is considering deep reductions on current transport CO2 emission levels; Delhi is seeking to break the huge projected rise in transport CO2 emissions.

The scale of policy intervention required to achieve these goals is huge and there is certainly little public discussion of the magnitude of the changes required. The paper argues for a `strategic conversation' at the city level, using scenario analysis, to discuss the priorities for intervention in delivering low carbon transport futures. A greater focus is required in developing participatory approaches to decision making, alongside network investments, urban planning, low emission vehicles and wider initiatives. Aspirations towards equitable target emissions may assist in setting sufficiently demanding targets. Only then is a wider awareness and ownership of potential carbon efficient transport futures likely to take place.},

It comes into use once a GIS database has been set up, with a digital data library, and expanded and linked to a global geographical two or three dimensional co-ordinate system. It exploits developments in IT and new data gathering and earth observing technologies, and takes the notion of GIS beyond data and towards its analysis, modelling, and use in problem solving. This book provides pointers on how to harness these technologies in tandem and in the context of multiple different subjects and problem areas.

It is also a primer - that is, a book which sets out the foundations and scope of this important emergent area from the same contemporary perspective. The catalyst to the emergence of geocomputation is the new and creative application of computers to devise and depict digital representations of the Earth's surface. The environment for geocomputation is provided by geographical information systems (GIS), yet geocomputation is much more than GIS. Geocomputation is a blend of research-led applications which emphasise process over form, dynamics over statics, and interaction over passive response. This book presents a timely blend of current research and practice, written by the leading figures in the field. It provides insights to a new and rapidly developing area, and identifies the key foundations to future developments. It should be read by all who seek to use geocomputational methods for solving real world problems.},

Chambers, the leading developer of the original S software, Extending R covers key concepts and techniques in R to support analysis and research projects. It presents the core ideas of R, provides programming guidance for projects of all scales, and introduces new, valuable techniques that extend R.  The book first describes the fundamental characteristics and background of R, giving readers a foundation for the remainder of the text. It next discusses topics relevant to programming with R, including the apparatus that supports extensions. The book then extends R's data structures through object-oriented programming, which is the key technique for coping with complexity. The book also incorporates a new structure for interfaces applicable to a variety of languages.  A reflection of what R is today, this guide explains how to design and organize extensions to R by correctly using objects, functions, and interfaces. It enables current and future users to add their own contributions and packages to R.},

Since its first release in 2004, SAGA has rapidly developed from a specialized tool for digital terrain analysis to a comprehensive and globally established GIS platform for scientific analysis and modeling. SAGA is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.},

  abstract = {"In an age of big data, data journalism and with a wealth of quantitative information around us, it is not enough for students to be taught only 100 year old statistical methods using 'out of the box' software. They need to have 21st-century analytical skills too. This is an excellent and student-friendly text from two of the world leaders in the teaching and development of spatial analysis. It shows clearly why the open source software R is not just an alternative to commercial GIS, it may actually be the better choice for mapping, analysis and for replicable research. Providing practical tips as well as fully working code, this is a practical 'how to' guide ideal for undergraduates as well as those using R for the first time. It will be required reading on my own courses." - Richard Harris, Professor of Quantitative Social Science, University of Bristol  R is a powerful open source computing tool that supports geographical analysis and mapping for the many geography and `non-geography' students and researchers interested in spatial analysis and mapping.   This book provides an introduction to the use of R for spatial statistical analysis, geocomputation and the analysis of geographical information for researchers collecting and using data with location attached, largely through increased GPS functionality.   Brunsdon and Comber take readers from `zero to hero' in spatial analysis and mapping through functions they have developed and compiled into R packages. This enables practical R applications in GIS, spatial analyses, spatial statistics, mapping, and web-scraping. Each chapter includes:      Example data and commands for exploring it     Scripts and coding to exemplify specific functionality     Advice for developing greater understanding - through functions such as locator(), View(), and alternative coding to achieve the same ends      Self-contained exercises for students to work through     Embedded code within the descriptive text.   ~This is a definitive 'how to' that takes students - of any discipline - from coding to actual applications and uses of R.},

  abstract = {Tropical arid to semi-arid ecosystems are nearly as diverse as more humid forests and occupy large parts of the tropics. In comparison, however, they are vastly understudied. For instance, fog precipitation alone supports a unique vegetation formation, locally termed lomas, on coastal mountains in the Peruvian desert. To effectively protect these highly endemic and threatened ecosystems, we must increase our understanding of their diversity patterns in relation to environmental factors. Consequently, we recorded all vascular species from 100 random 4~\texttimes{}~4~m plots on the fog-exposed southern slope of the mountain Mong\'on. We used topographic and remotely sensed covariates in statistical models to generate spatial predictions of alpha diversity and plant species' distribution probabilities. Altitude was the most important predictor in all models and may represent fog moisture levels. Other significant covariates in the models most likely refer also to water availability but on a finer spatial scale. Additionally, model-based clustering revealed five altitudinal vegetation zones. This study contributes to a better spatial understanding of the biodiversity and spatial arrangement of vegetation belts of the largely unknown but highly unique lomas formations. Furthermore, mapping species richness and plant species' distributions could support a long-needed lomas strategic conservation scheme.},

  abstract = {Most bicycle crash analyses are designed as explanatory studies. They aim to identify contributing risk factors and calculate risk rates based on \textendash{} most of the time \textendash{} highly aggregated statistical data. In contrast to such explanatory study designs, the presented study follows an exploratory approach, focusing on the absolute number of crashes. The aim is to reveal and describe patterns and dynamics of urban bicycle crashes on various spatial scale levels and temporal resolutions through a multi-stage workflow. Spatial units are delineated in the network space and serve as initial units of aggregation. In order to facilitate comparisons among regions and quantify temporal dynamics, a reference value of crash frequency is simulated for each unit of the respective spatial scale level and temporal resolution. For the presented case study, over 3000 geo-coded bicycle crashes in the city of Salzburg (Austria) were analyzed. The data set covers 10years and comprises all bicycle crashes reported by the police. Distinct spatial and temporal patterns with clusters, seasonal variations, and regional particularities could be revealed. These insights are indicators for urban dynamics in the transport system and allow for further, targeted in-depth analyses and subsequent counter measures. Moreover, the results prove the applicability of the proposed multi-stage workflow and demonstrate the added value of analyses of small aggregates on various scale levels, down to single crashes, and temporal resolutions.},

The XML and JSON data formats are widely used in Web services, regular Web pages and JavaScript code, and visualization formats such as SVG and KML for Google Earth and Google Maps. In addition, scientists use HTTP and other network protocols to scrape data from Web pages, access REST and SOAP Web Services, and interact with NoSQL databases and text search applications. This book provides a practical hands-on introduction to these technologies, including high-level functions the authors have developed for data scientists. It describes strategies and approaches for extracting data from HTML, XML, and JSON formats and how to programmatically access data from the Web. Along with these general skills, the authors illustrate several applications that are relevant to data scientists, such as reading and writing spreadsheet documents both locally and via GoogleDocs, creating interactive and dynamic visualizations, displaying spatial-temporal displays with Google Earth, and generating code from descriptions of data structures to read and write data. These topics demonstrate the rich possibilities and opportunities to do new things with these modern technologies.

This paper sheds light on the transport-education inequality nexus with reference to school accessibility by public transport in the SPMR. To assess school accessibility, we develop an accessibility index which combines information on the spatial distribution of adolescents, the location of existing schools, and the public transport provision serving the school catchment area into a single measure. The index is used to measure school accessibility locally across 633 areas within the SPMR. We use the index to simulate the impact of a policy aiming at increasing the centralisation of public secondary education provision, and find that it negatively affects public transport accessibility for students with the lowest levels of accessibility. These results illustrate how existing inequalities can be amplified by variable accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. The research suggests that educational inequality impacts of school agglomeration policies should be considered before centralisation takes place.},

  doi = {10.5198/jtlu.2016.862},
  abstract = {Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure and other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the right places, such as along `desire lines' of high latent demand. This creates the need for tools and methods to help answer the question `where to build?'. Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based `cycling futures.' Four scenarios are presented, including `Go Dutch' and `Ebikes,' which explore what would happen if English people had the same propensity to cycle as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level for each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of scenarios and deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.},

It is suitable for readers in any country.~ ~ The book is split into two parts. The first part is about the principles of transport modelling. This part talks about travel demand, transport networks, zones, trip matrices, the value of time, trip generation, mode split, destination choice, model calibration \textendash{} lots of scary words that need explaining in order to understand the role of models in the assessment of transport projects. All modes of transport are covered: cars, buses, trains, trucks, taxis, walking, cycling and others. Hot air balloons may be the only transport mode that is hardly mentioned.~ ~ The second part of the book covers more strategic issues. It talks about the culture of transport modelling, including the management of transport modelling work, the way model outputs are communicated, and the professional environment where this is done. This part of the book also contains an honest discussion of common modelling practices which should be recommended and others which should not.~ ~ ``Transport modelling for a complete beginner'' will help you ensure that anything you do with a transport model remains fair, effective and based on real evidence.},

In each society, maps served as critical economic, political, and personal tools, but there was little consistency in how and why they were made. Much like today, maps in antiquity meant very different things to different people. Ancient Perspectives presents an ambitious, fresh overview of cartography and its uses. The seven chapters range from broad-based analyses of mapping in Mesopotamia and Egypt to a close focus on Ptolemy's ideas for drawing a world map based on the theories of his Greek predecessors at Alexandria. The remarkable accuracy of Mesopotamian city-plans is revealed, as is the creation of maps by Romans to support the proud claim that their emperor's rule was global in its reach. By probing the instruments and techniques of both Greek and Roman surveyors, one chapter seeks to uncover how their extraordinary planning of roads, aqueducts, and tunnels was achieved. Even though none of these civilizations devised the means to measure time or distance with precision, they still conceptualized their surroundings, natural and man-made, near and far, and felt the urge to record them by inventive means that this absorbing volume reinterprets and compares.},

Today, increasingly the heart of a mapping project is, in fact, the computer program that implements some (geo)statistical algorithm to a given point data set. Purpose of this guide is to assist you in producing quality maps by using fully-operational tools, without a need for serious additional investments. It will first introduce you the to the basic principles of geostatistical mapping and regression-kriging, as the key prediction technique, then it will guide you through four software packages: ILWIS GIS, R+gstat, SAGA GIS and Google Earth, which will be used to prepare the data, run analysis and make final layouts. These materials have been used for the five-days advanced training course "Hands-on-geostatistics: merging GIS and spatial statistics", that is regularly organized by the author and collaborators.

The R package tmap offers a coherent plotting system for thematic maps that is based on the layered grammar of graphics. Thematic maps are created by stacking layers, where per layer, data can be mapped to one or more aesthetics. It is also possible to generate small multiples. Thematic maps can be further embellished by configuring the map layout and by adding map attributes, such as a scale bar and a compass. Besides plotting thematic maps on the graphics device, they can also be made interactive as an HTML widget. In addition, the R package tmaptools contains several convenient functions for reading and processing spatial data.},

  title = {Hyperparameters and {{Tuning Strategies}} for {{Random Forest}}},
  abstract = {The random forest algorithm (RF) has several hyperparameters that have to be set by the user, e.g., the number of observations drawn randomly for each tree and whether they are drawn with or without replacement, the number of variables drawn randomly for each split, the splitting rule, the minimum number of samples that a node must contain and the number of trees. In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures, also considering interactions between hyperparameters. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a brief overview of tuning strategies we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.},
