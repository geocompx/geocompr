E1. Think about the terms 'GIS'\index{GIS}, 'GDS' and 'geocomputation' described above. Which (if any) best describes the work you would like to do using geo* methods and software and why?

E2. Provide three reasons for using a scriptable language such as R for geocomputation instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) based GIS such as QGIS\index{QGIS}.

E3. In the year 2000 Stan Openshaw wrote that geocomputation involved "practical work that is beneficial or useful" to others. Think about a practical problem and possible solutions that could be informed with new evidence derived from the analysis, visualisation or modelling of geographic data. With a pen and paper (or computational equivalent) sketch inputs and possible outputs illustrating how geocomputation could help.
