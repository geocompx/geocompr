E1. Think about the terms 'GIS'\index{GIS}, 'GDS' and 'geocomputation' described above. Which (if any) best describes the work you would like to do using geo* methods and software and why?

E2. Provide three reasons for using a scriptable language such as R for geocomputation instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) based GIS such as QGIS\index{QGIS}.

E3. Think about real world problems you would like to solve with help from geographic data. Try sketching a workflow, with rectangles representing datsets and ovals representing methods/processes to transform them, with a pen and paper or a digital sketching tool such as Excalidraw.
