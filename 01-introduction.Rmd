This package is built by the [NHS-R community](https://nhsrcommunity.com) to provide tools for drawing statistical process control (SPC) charts. This package supports the
NHSE/I programme ['Making Data Count'](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/making-data-count/), and allows users to draw XmR charts, use change points, and apply rules with
summary indicators for when rules are breached.

Please be aware that this package is in the early stages of development, and features may change.

##### Installation

``` r
# install from CRAN
install.packages("NHSRplotthedots")

# Or install the development version from GitHub using {remotes} package:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRplotthedots", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

##### Overview

Welcome to the NHS-R community's package for building a specific type of
statistical process control (SPC) chart, the XmR chart. We are aiming to
support the NHS England and NHS Improvement's 'Making Data Count'
programme, please see [here](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/making-data-count/) for
more details. The programme encourages boards, managers, and analyst
teams to present data in ways that show change over time, and drive
better understanding of indicators than 'RAG' (red, amber, green) rated
board reports often present.

The help-files, and vignette within this package tell you more about the
possible options for controlling the charts, but below is a simple
example of the type of chart the package produces. We will use the
`ae_attendances` dataset from the `{NHSRdatasets}` package and a bit of
`{dplyr}` code to select some organisations.

``` r
library(NHSRplotthedots)
library(NHSRdatasets)
library(tidyverse)

sub_set <- ae_attendances %>% 
  filter(org_code == "RQM", type == 1, period < as.Date("2018-04-01"))

sub_set %>%
  ptd_spc(value_field = breaches, date_field = period, improvement_direction = "decrease")
```

<img src="/figures/README-example-1.png" width="70%" />

This plot is ok on it's own, but we can specify more control options
when we pass it on, using the `{dplyr}` pipe function below: `%>%` to
the plot argument.

``` r
sub_set %>%
  ptd_spc(value_field = breaches, date_field = period, improvement_direction = "decrease") %>% 
  plot(y_axis_label = "4-hour wait breaches",
       main_title = "SPC of A&E waiting time breaches for RQM")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="100%" />

or, equivalently:

``` r
sub_set %>%
  ptd_spc(value_field = breaches, date_field = period, improvement_direction = "decrease") %>% 
  ptd_create_ggplot(y_axis_label = "4-hour wait breaches",
                    main_title = "SPC of A&E waiting time breaches for RQM")
```

##### Getting help:

To find out more about the `ptd_spc()` function, you can view the help
with:

``` r
?ptd_spc
```

Details on the extra plot controls can be found using:

``` r
?ptd_create_ggplot
```

To view the vignette (worked example), use:

``` r
vignette("intro", package = "NHSRplotthedots")

vignette(package = "NHSRplotthedots")
```
