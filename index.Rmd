# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the **geocompr** [website](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr), the online home of our forthcoming book with [CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER).

## Development {-}

Inspired by the **bookdown** [R package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) we are developing this book in the open.
We decided to make the book open source to encourage contributions, ensure reproducibility and provide access to the material as it evolves.

The latest version is hosted at [robinlovelace.net/geocompr](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr).
This website is kept up-to-date thanks to Travis, a continuous integration (CI) service.
Travis automatically rebuilds the book and finds bugs by reporting the 'build status' after every update.
Currently the build is:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr) 

The version of the book you are reading now was built on `r Sys.Date()` and was built `r if(is_on_travis) "on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr)" else "locally"`.
**bookdown** makes editing a book as easy as editing a wiki.
To do so, just click on the 'edit me' icon highlighted in the image below.
Which-ever chapter you are looking at, this will take you to the source [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file hosted on GitHub. If you have a GitHub account, you'll be able to make changes there and submit a pull request. If you do not, it's time to [sign-up](https://github.com/)!

To raise an issue about the book's content (e.g. code not running) or make a feature request, check-out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues).

## Reproducibility {-}

To reproduce the book, you need a recent version of R and up-to-date packages.
The following code should install the required packages:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=is_online}
if(!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/geocompr")
devtools::install_github("nowosad/spData")
```

To build the book locally, clone or [download](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/archive/master.zip) the repo and run the following line from the [project](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/geocompr.Rproj)'s root directory:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd") # to build the book
browseURL("_book/index.html") # to view it
```

For further details see the book's GitHub page at [Robinlovelace/geocompr](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr#geocomputation-with-r).
