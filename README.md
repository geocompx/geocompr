Summary of the changes
</summary>

Since commencing work on the Second Edition in September 2021 much has
changed, including:

- Replacement of `raster` with `terra` in Chapters 1 to 7 (see commits
  related to this update
  [here](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/search?q=terra&type=commits))
- Update of Chapter 7 to include mention alternative ways or reading-in
  OSM data in [\#656](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/pull/656)
- Refactor build settings so the book builds on Docker images in the
  [geocompr/docker](https://github.com/geocompx/docker) repo
- Improve the experience of using the book in Binder (ideal for trying
  out the code before installing or updating the necessary R packages),
  as documented in issue
  [\#691](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/issues/691) (thanks to
  [yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda))
- Improved communication of binary spatial predicates in Chapter 4 (see
  [\#675](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/pull/675))
- New section on the links between subsetting and clipping (see
  [\#698](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/pull/698)) in Chapter 5
- New
  [section](https://r.geocompx.org/spatial-operations.html#de-9im-strings)
  on the dimensionally extended 9-intersection model (DE-9IM)
- New [chapter](https://r.geocompx.org/raster-vector.html) on
  raster-vector interactions split out from Chapter 5
- New
  [section](https://r.geocompx.org/spatial-class.html#the-sfheaders-package)
  on the **sfheaders** package
- New [section](https://r.geocompx.org/spatial-class.html#s2) in Chapter
  2 on spherical geometry engines and the **s2** package
- Replacement of code based on the old **mlr** package with code based
  on the new **mlr3** package, as described in a huge [pull
  request](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/pull/771)
  <!-- Todo: update this bullet point (Rl 2021-11) -->
  <!-- - Next issue  -->

During the project we aim to contribute ‚Äòupstream‚Äô to the packages that
make geocomputation with R possible. This impact is recorded in
[`our-impact.csv`](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/blob/main/misc/our-impact.csv).

## Downloading the source code

The recommended way to get the source code underlying Geocomputation
with R on your computer is by cloning the repo. You can can that on any
computer with [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) installed
with the following command:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr.git
```

An alternative approach, which we recommend for people who want to
contribute to open source projects hosted on GitHub, is to install the
[`gh` CLI tool](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation). From there
cloning a fork of the source code, that you can change and share
(including with Pull Requests to improve the book), can be done with the
following command:

``` bash
gh repo fork geocompx/geocompr # (gh repo clone geocompx/geocompr # also works)
```

Both of those methods require you to have Git installed. If not, you can
download the book‚Äôs source code from the URL
<https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/archive/refs/heads/main.zip> .
Download/unzip the source code from the R command line to increase
reproducibility and reduce time spent clicking around:

``` r
u = "https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
f = basename(u)
download.file(u, f)        # download the file
unzip(f)                   # unzip it
file.rename(f, "geocompr") # rename the directory
rstudioapi::openProject("geococompr") # or open the folder in vscode / other IDE
```

## Reproducing the book in R/RStudio/VS Code

To ease reproducibility, we created the `geocompkg` package. Install it
with the following commands:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
# To reproduce the first Part (chapters 1 to 8):
install.packages('geocompkg', repos = c('https://geocompr.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'), dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

Installing `geocompkg` will also install core packages required for
reproducing **Part I of the book** (chapters 1 to 8). Note: you may also
need to install [system
dependencies](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#installing) if you‚Äôre
running Linux (recommended) or Mac operating systems. You also need to
have the [**remotes**](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes/) package
installed:

To reproduce book **in its entirety**, run the following command (which
installs additional ‚ÄòSuggests‚Äô packages, this may take some time to
run!):

``` r
# Install packages to fully reproduce book (may take several minutes):
options(repos = c(
  geocompx = 'https://geocompx.r-universe.dev',
  cran = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/'
))
# From geocompx.r-universe.dev (recommended):
install.packages("geocompkg", dependencies = TRUE)

# Alternatively from GitHub:
remotes::install_github("geocompr/geocompkg", dependencies = TRUE)
```

You need a recent version of the GDAL, GEOS, PROJ and udunits libraries
installed for this to work on Mac and Linux. See the **sf** package‚Äôs
[README](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) for information on that. After
the dependencies have been installed you should be able to build and
view a local version the book with:

``` r
# Change this depending on where you have the book code stored:
rstudioapi::openProject("~/Downloads/geocompr")
 # or code /location/of/geocompr in the system terminal
 # or cd /location/of/geocompr then R in the system terminal, then:
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd") # to build the book
browseURL("_book/index.html")      # to view it
# Or, to serve a live preview the book and observe impact of changes:
bookdown::serve_book()
```

<!-- The code associated with each chapter is saved in the `code/chapters/` folder. -->
<!-- `source("code/chapters/07-transport.R")` runs run the code chunks in chapter 7, for example. -->
<!-- These R scripts are generated with the follow command which wraps `knitr::purl()`: -->

## Geocompr in a devcontainer

A great feature of VS Code is
[devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers),
which allow you to develop in an isolated Docker container. If you have
VS Code and the necessary dependencies installed on your computer, you
can build Geocomputation with R in a devcontainer as shown below (see
[\#873](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/issues/873) for details):

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/193398022-bbcfbfda-5d57-4c57-8db3-ed1fdb4a07be.png)

## Geocompr in Binder

For many people the quickest way to get started with Geocomputation with
R is in your web browser via Binder. To see an interactive RStudio
Server instance click on the following button, which will open
[mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geocompx/geocompr/main?urlpath=rstudio)
with an R installation that has all the dependencies needed to reproduce
the book:

[![Launch Rstudio
Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geocompx/geocompr/main?urlpath=rstudio)

You can also have a play with the repository in RStudio Cloud by
clicking on this link (requires log-in):

Cloud](images/cloud.png)](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1642300)

## Geocomputation with R in a Docker container

See the [geocompx/docker](https://github.com/geocompx/docker) repository
for details.

## Reproducing this README

To reduce the book‚Äôs dependencies, scripts to be run infrequently to
generate input for the book are run on creation of this README.

The additional packages required for this can be installed as follows:

``` r
source("code/extra-pkgs.R")
```

With these additional dependencies installed, you should be able to run
the following scripts, which create content for the book, that we‚Äôve
removed from the main book build to reduce package dependencies and the
book‚Äôs build time:

``` r
source("code/01-cranlogs.R")
source("code/sf-revdep.R")
source("code/09-urban-animation.R")
source("code/09-map-pkgs.R")
```

Note: the `.Rproj` file is configured to build a website not a single
page. To reproduce this
[README](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/blob/main/README.Rmd) use
the following command:

``` r
rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd", output_format = "github_document", output_file = "README.md")
```

<!-- An indication of the book's progress over time is illustrated below (to be updated roughly every week as the book progresses). -->
<!-- Book statistics: estimated number of pages per chapter over time. -->

## Citations

The main packages used in this book are cited from `packages.bib`. Other
citations are stored online using Zotero.

If you would like to add to the references, please use Zotero, join the
[open group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/418217/energy-and-transport)
add your citation to the open [geocompr
library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/418217/energy-and-transport/items/collectionKey/9K6FRP6N).

We use the following citation key format:

    [auth:lower]_[veryshorttitle:lower]_[year]

This can be set from inside Zotero desktop with the Better Bibtex plugin
installed (see
[github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex))
by selecting the following menu options (with the shortcut `Alt+E`
followed by `N`), and as illustrated in the figure below:

    Edit > Preferences > Better Bibtex

![](images/zotero-settings.png)

Zotero settings: these are useful if you want to add references.

When you export the citations as a .bib file from Zotero, use the
`Better BibTex` (not `BibLaTeX`) format.

We use Zotero because it is a powerful open source reference manager
that integrates well with citation tools in VS Code and RStudio.
